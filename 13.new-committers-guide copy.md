# New Committers Guide

[TOC]

## Guide for new committers
The plain sense of the word "committer" is that you will have access rights to your project's repository to write (as well as read) the source. Rather than creating a patch and submitting it to be actively reviewed and then (hopefully) committed, you can now create a local patch and commit it yourself - or even review and commit patches created by others. Your patches will still be reviewed by your fellow committers. This will happen after the event (usually through commit emails, although the exact convention for the review may differ between projects).

Take more care than you did before and expect existing committers to be particularly vigilant. You would already know well (by example) how a committer should behave. If you are not familiar, you can always ask your PMC for guidance.

## Contributor license agreement
The very first thing you need to do is to complete and submit an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA). This is a formal delcaration declaration of the terms under which you will contribute intellectual property to the ASF.

You can send in the ICLA either by postal mail, fax or by emailing a scan of the signed copy to secretary@apache.org. Please ensure that it is clearly written. Your PMC will keep track to know when the ICLA is received and recorded by the ASF Secretary (this might take time).

Note that you may need to hold discussions with your employer before signing the agreement. Your employer might even need to provide a Corporate CLA - determining that is your responsibility. Also make sure that you keep up-to-date with this requirement.

It is important to read and understand the agreements and strive to meet the standards expected. Correct title to the source is of great importance to ASF and it must be to you too. Some procedures may appear a little bureaucratic, but they are there to protect you as well as ASF. For a clearer understanding read the ASF license guide.

Please take care to ensure that patches are original works which have been clearly contributed to the ASF in public. In the case of any doubt (or when a contribution with a more complex history is presented) please consult your project PMC before committing it.

## Before account creation
You will also be asked for a preferred Apache user name. Please think also of an alternative, in the case that the primary is unsuitable or taken. Note that your user name must not contain punctuation. (This list may prove helpful).

The acceptance process may well take some time. The ASF is staffed by volunteers working in their free time. It often takes some time for requests to be processed and new accounts set up. Please be patient. You will be informed when the process is complete (and your PMC chair will monitor the progress).

This quiet lull is a good time to familiarize yourself with the Apache Software Foundation in general. Browse the developer information and the Foundation website. Remember, that the website is being continually updated, so you should regularly visit these pages.

You will also need to familiarize yourself with some Apache policies and procedures. Do not worry, this isn't as intimidating as it seems: you will probably have learnt a lot by osmosis already. But it is important to know where authoritative information is held when you need to consult it. Unfortunately it is currently scattered. There is ongoing an effort to bring it all together. What follows is a partial list:

If there is anything that you are not sure about, then just ask on the "dev" list for your particular project.

* [ASF Developer Resources](http://www.apache.org/dev/index.html)
* the ASF How it works document
* [the Incubator Learn pages](http://incubator.apache.org/learn/theapacheway.html)
* the ASF Bylaws
* and the ASF general wiki.

### Account creation
You will receive an email when your account has been created. (This may take a week or two.)

There are a number of general things you need to do. These will be covered in separate sections below. There may some other things that the particular project requires, but you should be told of those by your fellow committers.

Setting up the account at this time is convenient (since the logon needs to be tested).

### Setting up SSH
The first steps are to log onto the account on this server via ssh and configure your ssh details:

```
$ ssh [username]@people.apache.org
```

We are not going to describe how to use ssh (there are plenty of good tutorials elsewhere).

To use key-based login, basically you need to generate the key on your local desktop (not on people.apache.org) and then upload your public key to your ~/.ssh directory, configure it properly, then you will not need your password for SSH logins.

If you cannot login, you need to check (via the project PMC) that the account has been created correctly. Please check your ssh configuration first (do ssh -e).

If you use PuTTY then ensure that it is configured to force SSH v2 protocol. And use keyboard-interactive.

Once you are logged on, there are few tasks best performed right away. Please take care when using your shell account.

You need to check that your umask is set in a group friendly fashion. This ensures that the documents you create are editable by your fellow committers. To do this, (depending on which shell you use) edit the .cshrc file or .profile (sh derivatives) and ensure that the umask is set as follows:

``` 
umask 002
```

You may find that a umask line already exists, in which case it should be modified. Otherwise, a new line needs to be added. (You will need to use a *nix command-line editor such as vi.) Tip: You can view the files of some other committer, e.g. ls -al ~mymentor; cat ~mymentor/.cshrc

Warning: Ensure that the .ssh directory and all files within are not group writable to prevent other users from hijacking your account by placing their public keys there. In the case that StrictModes is set to yes in the openssh configuration, using keys would not be possible at all with a group writable .ssh directory.

### Setting up email
See these instructions.

### Subversion access and Web sites
All the information you need is contained here.

If your project has a page about the developers and committers, go right ahead and add your name and information to it! Really. This is a great way to make your first commit.

It also serves another purpose: you will learn how to add documentation to your project's website and the technology used to build it. Documentation is vital, and being able to improve the project's web site is a skill that you will need. If your project has not documented how to rebuild the website, then ask on your dev mailing list and use the answer to create a document describing how to do that. It will be gratefully received!

Here are some general infrastructure notes about how to manage your project website.

### Security and PGP
Security is vital and Apache pays great attention to it. Please remember that at all times.

OpenPGP is a standard which provides (amongst other things) methods to create digital signatures for documents. These documents could be emails or could be ASF releases. A variety of applications exist which provide OpenPGP compatible signatures including the well known GPG and PGP.

It is recommended that you create a PGP key for your apache.org address now (or add that address to an existing key, if you have one). DO NOT create this key on people.apache.org or any other machine to which multiple users have access and DO NOT, ever, copy your private key to people.apache.org or any other shared machine. Release managers need to take particular care of keys used to sign releases.

Upload the public key to a public key server (for example MIT). Afterwards, add your keys' primary fingerprints to your LDAP profile; this will cause your to be added to the individual and per-project pre-fetched KEYS files on https://people.apache.org/keys/, and allow automated tools to encrypt communications to you. Start to build up a good web of trust now before you need to use it in earnest. Be prepared to exchange key information at any face-to-face events where ASF folks may be present. The best practice is to insist on identification before signing another's key. See signing guide and Henk's Key Signing HOWTO.

Henk's Apache home page provides some useful information related to the use of signatures both in general and specifically at Apache. See also the signing guide.

### Other resources
Apache People maintains public resources about Apache committers. Participation is easy but optional. If you want to take part, now is a good time to add your details.

Although the Apache Way is to keep things as public as possible, there are some resources here at Apache which are closed to those who are not committers.

Committers-only Subversion modules
You should do a checkout of the private committers module. This is stored in the subversion repository with url https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers. (See notes for those unfamiliar with subversion.)

Once you have checked out this module, you need to read all the documents contained in the docs directory, especially the resources.txt file. There are a number of private mailing lists you need to know about. Join in the Apache community by signing up to every list that interests you. It is better to sign up (even if you sign off later) than to miss out! Please respect the usage guidelines for these private lists.

### Community
The community makes Apache fun. The community list is a public readable list for topics that cut across PMC boundaries. Discussions of all kinds are on topic as long as the matter doesn't need to be sensitive or confidential.

The Apache Labs project is open to all ASF Committers (and only them).

Apache Labs is a place for innovation where committers of the foundation can experiment with new ideas. The aim is to provide the necessary resource to promote and maintain the innovative power within the Apache community without the burden of community building.

If you have an idea that you want to explore and collaborate on with other committers then come and discuss it at Labs. Even if you don't have anything at the moment, then come and take a look at what other committers are working on.

### Responsibilities
Join your project's commit mailing list if one exists (some projects send all commit emails to the dev list).

Each committer has a responsibility to monitor the changes made for potential issues, both coding and legal. If you spot any potential issues in a commit, the right course of action is to post a reply (to the email) raising your concerns to the dev list. In extreme situations, it may be necessary to veto (-1) a commit but please beware that this is an extreme sanction and rarely warranted.

Do not be surprised if your first commit has a delayed diff email. It needs to go through the human moderators.

###  ApacheCon
If you don't have one already, make a note in your diary about the next ApacheCon. This is a great opportunity to meet other Apache folks, hack code and dream about great new open source projects. Watch the lists as the conference dates approach for details about special deals for committers and opportunities to speak.

### Personal web space
You might already be aware that some Apache folks have content served from Apache web servers. For example, Henk and Vadim both provide statistics. There are no fixed guidelines about appropriate content: committers should know how to behave! Most other folks use it for Apache related content and some for interesting private projects. If you do use it, please use it responsibly.

Material placed in the public_html directory will be available under thehttp://people.apache.org/~ username /url (where username is your ASF account Id).

### Identity theft
Please be aware that Apache Software Foundation committers are targets for identity theft. These spoof attacks resemble the phishing attacks used to gain access to bank accounts and other web subscriptions. They typically seek to persuade you to enter your access details into a fake website. The foundation will never solicit such 'verification'.

Leaking your access to Apache can have very destructive consequences. Never disclose your ASF password to anyone.

The Apache team is clueful about DNS maintenance: do not trust any redirection by IP address. Your access to Apache will be through the machines serving the svn.apache.org and people.apache.org domains. The ssh/ssl fingerprints are listed on the machines page.

Please use caution. Do not hesitate to ask if you have doubts: post a question to infrastructure before taking any action.

Note: the fingerprint for the key used for ssh is different to the fingerprint of the certificate used to securely serve the website. A full list of fingerprints is maintained on the machines page.
