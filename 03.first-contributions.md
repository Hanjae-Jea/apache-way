# First Contributions
The more you give the more you get out.

It's natural to assume that, as a newcomer, you have little to offer the ASF. However, you will be surprised at how much you can help, even now.

Since we aim to be a place for newcomers to learn about the ASF as a whole and you are (probably) a newcomer any feedback you can give or unanswered questions you can ask us here will help us improve what we offer to those who come afterwards.

Feedback can be provided on this website and questions asked about anything Apache by subscribing to our mailing list by sending a mail to dev-subscribe@community.apache.org. Once subscribed you can send your mail to dev@community.apache.org.
