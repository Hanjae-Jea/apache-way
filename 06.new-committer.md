# 새 커미터 선발

새로운 커미터를 찾기 위해, 전체 커뮤니티가 하는 일은 커미터들의 의견을 구하고 관련 문서를 처리하는 것입니다.

Each project has different approaches to managing new committers, this page describes a common process found in many Apache projects. It also provides drafts for the various communications that are necessary.
각 프로젝트들은 새로운 커미터를 뽑기 위해 다양한 방법으로 접근하고 있는데, 이 페이지에서는 대부분의 아파치 프로젝트에서 사용하는 프로세스와 필요한 커뮤니케이션을 설명합니다.

## Guidelines for assessing new candidates for committership
## 새 후보를 위한 가이드 라인
When voting, all PMC members need to make up your own mind, perhaps search mailing lists and Jira, etc. The following are some tips that we developed. Also consider the Apache Forrest committer guidelines.
모든 PMC 멤버들은 메일링 리스트,  Jira, 기타 등등에서 새로운 후보를 정해야 합니다. 아래 팁들은 아파치 재단에서 Apache Forrest 커미터를 뽑기 위한 가이드로도 사용되는 몇 가지 평가 방법입니다.

### Ability to work cooperatively with peers.
### 동료들과 협업할 수 있는 능력.
How do we evaluate? By the interactions they have through mail. By how they respond to criticism. By how they participate in decision-making process.
이메일 통신을 통해 비판에 어떻게 반응하는지,의사결정 프로세스에 어떻게 참여하는지를 기준으로 평가할 수 있습니다.

### Ability to be a mentor.
### 멘토가 될 능력.
How do we evaluate? By the interactions they have through mail. By how clear they are and how willing they are to point at appropriate background materials (or even create them).
이메일 통신으로 정확한 배경 지식을 명확하게 알려주며, 많이 알려주고 노력하는지를 기준으로 평가할 수 있습니다.

### Community
### 커뮤니티
How do we evaluate? By the interactions they have through mail. Do they help to answer questions raised on the mailing list; do they show a helpful attitude and respect for other's ideas.
이메일 리스트에서 발생한 질문을 잘 해결해주는지, 다른 사람의 아이디어를 얼마나 존중하고 긍정적인 태도로 받아들이는지를 기준으로 평가할 수 있습니다.

### Committment
### 기여도
How do we evaluate? By time, by sticking through tough issues, by helping on not-so-fun tasks as well.
까다로운 이슈나, 조금 지루한 일에도 도움을 주는지를 기준으로 평가할 수 있습니다.

### Personal skill/ability
### 개인적 능력/역량
How do we evaluate? A solid general understanding of the project. Quality of discussion in mail. Patches (where applicable) easy to apply with only a cursory review.
프로젝트에 대해 잘 이해하거나, 주고 받는 이메일의 수준이나, 작성한 패치가 쉽게 적용한지를 기준으로 평가할 수 있습니다.

## New Committer Process
## 새 커미터 선발 프로세스
This section describes a typical Apache projects process for handling the voting of a new committer. Templates mentioned in the process appear at later in this document.
이 항목에서는 많은 Apache 프로젝트들이 새로운 커미터를 어떻게 뽑는지에 대해서 설명합니다. 관련한 문서 양식은 문서 뒤 쪽에서 언급됩니다.

### Summary

### Discussion
### 논의

We do the vote on the private mailing list to enable a frank discussion.
우리는 내부적인 메일링 리스트에서 솔직한 의견을 구합니다.

Start a separate Vote thread for each new person. This makes it much easier to review the mail archives.
각 새로운 사람에 대한 의견을 구하는 쓰레드를 따로 시작합니다. 이게 이메일 저장에 훨씬 편리합니다.

In most cases, we will be inviting people to go straight from developer to PMC member. However, there may be extraordinary cases where we want limited work-related commit access. This will be resolved during the vote discussion.
대부분의 경우, 사람들을 개발자에서 바로 PMC멤버로 초대합니다. 그러나, 제한된 커밋 권한을 가져야 하는 특수한 경우가 있을 수도 있습니다. 이 경우 토의 과정에서 결정이 됩니다.

We need to be sure that they are committed people that we can work with. They will be our peers. We will have already observed that they are committed to the project and graceful toward users and other developers.
우리와 함께 해나갈 커미터라는 확신이 필요합니다. 이들은 우리의 동료가 되기 때문입니다. 우리는 이미 이 사람들이 프로젝트와 사용자들과 다른 개발자들에게 훌룽한기여를 했다는 것을 관찰했습니다. 

Don't wait too long before proposing and don't be too hasty. There is a trade-off and something about timeliness. A point is reached where it becomes obvious that we should invite them. This encourages them and keeps them enthusiastic. If we leave it too long, then we risk them becoming disillusioned.

On the PMC list we can each say exactly what we feel about each person, with no holds barred. Keep the discussion concise. The praise part can be done later in public.

See the end of this document for some guidelines to help you to assess a candidate.

Let the Vote thread run for one week.

A positive result is achieved by Consensus Approval i.e. at least 3 +1 votes and no vetoes.

Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and be prepared to defend it. Other members can attempt to encourage them to change.

New PMC members can be either quiet or active as they choose. If we find that certain people lapse and don't ever contribute, then we can take steps to retire them.

After a positive result, we give them a chance to decline in private. They can post a reply to the PMC mailing list.

After we reach a decision on the PMC list, and after the steps above, we will announce it on the dev list. We can then each follow up with our praise in public.

Other notes about the process are available on the main Apache site

### Committer Invite Template
This is the suggested invitation email to send to the newly elected committer, sent after a positive result from the vote for a new committer.
```
------------------------------------------------------------
To: JoeBloggs@foo.net
Cc: private@[PROJECT].apache.org
Subject: Invitation to become [PROJECT] committer: Joe Bloggs

Hello [invitee name],

The [Project] Project Management Committee] (PMC) 
hereby offers you committer privileges to the project 
[as well as membership in the PMC]. These privileges are
offered on the understanding that you'll use them
reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust
rather than unnecessary constraints.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make 
changes without needing to go through the patch 
submission process. [Being a PMC member enables you 
to guide the direction of the project.]

Being a committer does not require you to 
participate any more than you already do. It does 
tend to make one even more committed.  You will 
probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a 
contributor, participating as you do now.

A. This personal invitation is a chance for you to 
accept or decline in private.  Either way, please 
let us know in reply to the [private@project.apache.org] 
address only.

B. If you are accepting, the next step is to register 
an iCLA with the Apache Software Foundation:
    1. Details of the iCLA and the forms are found 
    through this link: <http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas>.

    2. The form (text or PDF version) provides 
    instructions for its completion and return to 
    the Secretary of the ASF.

    3. When you transmit the completed iCLA, request 
    to notify the Apache [Project] and choose a 
    unique Apache id. Look to see if your preferred 
    id is already taken at 
    http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html     
    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC 
    when your iCLA has been recorded.

When recording of your iCLA is noticed, you will 
receive a follow-up message with the next steps for 
establishing you as a committer.
```

### Committer Accept Template
This is the followup email after the new committer has accepted the invitation
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To: JoeBloggs@foo.net
Cc: private@[PROJECT].apache.org
Subject: Re: invitation to become [PROJECT] committer

Welcome. Here are the next steps. After that we will make
an announcement to the [PROJECT]-dev list.

You need to send a Contributor License Agreement to the ASF.
Normally you would send an Individual CLA. If you also make
contributions done in work time or using work resources then
see the Corporate CLA. Ask us if you have any issues.
http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

You need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives.
In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at
http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

Please notify us when you have submitted the CLA and by what means 
you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has 
been recorded.

After that is done, please make followup replies to the [PROJECT]-dev list.
We generally discuss everything there and keep the
private@[PROJECT].apache.org list for occasional matters which must be private.

The developer section of the website describes the roles and provides other
resources:
  http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
  http://www.apache.org/dev/

The incubator also has some useful information for new committers
in incubating projects:
  http://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html
  http://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html

In the absence of our own guidelines document we are currently 
using those developed at Apache Forrest:
http://forrest.apache.org/guidelines.html

Yours,
The Apache [PROJECT] PMC
```

### Committer Account Creation
Follow the instructions at: http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter

In summary the account creation request is made by the PMC Chair (or any ASF Member if the chair is unavailable)

PMC chair needs to use the ASF New Account Request form to send a new account request. Members may use ASF New Account Request page for ASF members to use.

For elections held on public lists, please supply the mail-archives.apache.org url. For private lists, you can use the Mail Search tool to locate the apprpropriate url.

### Committer Announce Template
This is the email to announce to [PROJECT]-dev once the account has been created.

```
------------------------------------------------------------
To: dev@[PROJECT].apache.org
Subject: new committer: ###Joe Bloggs

The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache [PROJECT]
has asked Joe Bloggs to become a committer and we are pleased 
to announce that they have accepted.

### add specific details here ###

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
Being a PMC member enables assistance with the management
and to guide the direction of the project.
```

### Committer Done Template
```
After the committer account is established.

------------------------------------------------------------
To: private@[PROJECT].a.o, ###JoeBloggs@foo.net
Subject: account request: ###Joe Bloggs

####, as you know, the ASF Infrastructure has set up your
committer account as the username '####'.

Please follow the instructions to set up your SSH,
svn password, svn configuration, mail forwarding, etc.
http://www.apache.org/dev/#committers

Please subscribe to the [PROJECT] Project Management 
Committee mailing list private@[PROJECT].apache.org.

You have commit access to specific sections of the
ASF repository, as follows:

[PROJECT] has various resources at:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]

The general "committers" at:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

You will probably need to 'svn switch" previous checkouts to now use https, 
for example:

svn switch --relocate http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]

If you have any questions during this phase, then please
see the following resources:

Apache developer's pages: http://www.apache.org/dev/
Incubator committer guide: http://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the [PROJECT] dev mailing list. 
Documentation is maintained by volunteers and hence can be out-of-date and incomplete - of course
you can now help fix that.

A PMC member will announce your election to the dev list soon.
```
